Log off thoughts:
Async Storage fixed. Mention that you added comments when this file is commited

For the love of god do not do onboarding the same way you did before. Look up a tutorial on save data/cache and onboarding.

Pretty sure React Native won't be able to run a python script so its likely that the app will have to 
interact with an API for the two to connect. Setup flask endpoint API and upload the information there.

Update:
It seems to be possible to have react interact with python if you create an api. The idea is that when you call
it the script will run as expected. Then return the information.

I'm still not sure how to do this though considering I need the api to be running in the background not on the phone.
My current thinking:

Oboarding
If none exist, create save data file and save the following content:

    - Name
    - Region

Then using this information somehow run the script with info from that file?

Precipitation, dew point, and Humidity among other weather factors seem to be conditional so you're going to
have to write a function that looks at if these things are present or not.

You should write a function that checks whether or not the APIs were called successfully.
Maybe which failed and if all failed consider an offline mode?
